This java program demonstrates method overloading- a core concept in object oriented programmming (OOPs) where multipe methods share the same name but differ in the number or type of parameters.
The class Sum contains three overloaded sum() i.e methods :
  * One that takes two integers 
  * One that takes three integers 
  * One that takes two double values
The Method_overloading class contains the main() (i.e the main method),which creates an instance of Sum and calls the different overloaded methods to showcase how Java resolves which method to call based on the arguments provided.
